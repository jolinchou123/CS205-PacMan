# CS205-PacMan
http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html

Learning Goals/Objective
In this project your goals are to learn how to implement some of the searches we have learned in class in a fun game. You will be implementing Depth First Search, Breadth First Search, A* search, Uniform Cost Search, a greedy search, and various heuristics. You will be able to see first hand what each search is good at and gain a better understanding of where they would be used. 
You may work in a group of at most 3 people. All submissions for your group will be group-based. So appoint a person who will be responsible for maintaining the deliverables. 
Due dates
Deliverables due each week, final report due in Week 6.
